# Intersubjective Geometry

"You cannot go from an informal description to a formal description by
formal means." --I wish I knew who said that.

How far can we get on pure intersubjectivity?

We give an informal description fo the intersubjective condition, and
then try to give a formal method of doing it.

Certainly not uncriticizable.  But I hope it will be interesting and
useful, that is to say, I hope you are not bored while reading it, and
after reading it you can do a lot of useful things you weren't able to
do before.


## The Intersubjective Scenario

###  Subjectivity

From James Conant's Lecture "McDowell's Kant".  Two different senses
of "subjective":

1.  A sensation/cognition/perception etc can be said to be subjective
    if it depends essentially somehow on the particular constitution
    of the subject.

    Paradigmatic example: colors.  If you are colorblind, you can't
    see colors.  It seems like colors are subjective in this sense: in
    order to gain knowledge about that aspect of reality, you have to
    be constituted in a particular way.

2.  A sensation/cognition/perception etc can be said to be subjective
    if it appears to give genuine information about the world, but
    upon careful scruteny we find that claim simply can't be
    sustained.  Its fake news.

One might wonder whether or not #1 implies #2.

McDowell's reading of Kant has him asking even a more fundamentally
skeptical question: how is it that sensations/congitions/perceptions,
can so much as appear to be capable of being true or false?

E.G. your cognition of Tony Soprano saying he will break your leg if
you don't pay him his money really seems to be capable of being true
or false.  In fact, it has every appearance of being objectively true.
Under what conditions can cognitions even have the appearance of being
true or false?

McDowell's reading of Kant is that Kant's project is to take a very
careful analysis of what has to be the case if appearances are even
capabile of looking like they could be true or false, and from that
analysis conclude that #1 does not imply #2.

Conclusion: Our forms of congnition can be subjective in the first
sense, without being in the second sense "merely" subjective.
Cf. McDowell, Brandom, etc.


####  What is a subject?

Critical Obligation --  Material incompatibilities
Ampliative Obligation -- acknowledge implications

Engaging in these activities is synthesizing a self -- which shows up
and who is responsible for these.

The rules which settle these are the categories.

####  What is an object?

Subjects are what repel incompatible committments, in that they *should* not hold them.
Objects are what repel incompatible properties, in that they *cannot* exhibit them.

Hume:

1.  On the side of the objects:  how can we move from how things is to how they ought to be?
2.  On the side of theoretical reasoning:  how can we move from what in fact happens to what must happen?

Kant: we can't be in this position:  understanding facts without understanding modal concepts.
Sellars:  concepts as involving laws and unintelligible without them.

Being able to employ concepts such as "cat" and "mat" in empirical
claims, means we already know how to reason modally about them.

Kant's freedom:
Not freedom from some kind of constriaint.
Spontinaity is the capacity to make judgements. Which is comitting
oneself.  Its a kind of authority--the authority to bind oneself.

i.e. when you turn 18, you can bind yourself in contracts.  take out a
mortgage, etc.  Freedom consists in being able to be bound by norms.

What is the difference between normative modality and alethic modality?
What's the difference between aquiring a belief and aquiring a property?


### Intersubjectivity

Triangulation.  In order to gain the same knowledge about the world, a
subject shouldn't have to recapitulate the entire history of science.

Brandom: you can't commit yourself to an obligation if you are
simultaniously the one who is the final arbiter about what that
obligation means.

There has to be some external authority you are recognizing.  To make
truth claims about an object, you have to hold yourself accountable to
that object, and the material inferences etc.  But you also have to
hold yourself accountable to community standards for evaluating such.


#  Minimal/basic model of intersubjective condition.

This section attempts to give a formal description of minimal
intersubjective situation.  Simplified enough to be able to draw
conclusions from; detailed enough to draw reasonable conclusions from.

We have 3 agents:  Ashely, Baily, and Corey.

They can move around in space.  They each have access to some kind of
peridodic process they can use as a very accurate clock.

Sensation: they can emit a stream of particles in any direction and
detect them again if they bounce off of anything back at them.

### Constraints to make subjective sensation possible:

1.  The sensing particles must move in a straight line at a constant
    velocity. If they didn't then we wouldn't be able to use them to
    measure the position and velocity of other objects around us.

2.  The particles must move faster than anything else.  Otherwise
    there would be some objects we couldn't sense.

3.  The clock must be accurate.  Insert stuff here from Carnap.  There
    is another holistic constraint that all periodic processes must
    converge somehow.

4.  Unity and centrality of the subject.  You are the
    center of your world.   The origin.


### Constraints to make instersubjective agreement possible:

3.  The particles must move at the same constant speed for everybody.

4.  You are the center of the world....just like everybody else.
    The other subjects also are the centers of their own worlds,

    and the language we use to describe positions, velocities, etc must be
    such that each subject can rephrase their observations such that
    they were coming from another subject.

    Practically speaking this means we have to be able to do coordinate
    transforms.

5.  Charity:  Most of the agents tell the truth most of the time.
    This is necessary so we can check ourselves and others for error.


###  Bramdom's minimal set

See making it explicit.

1.  To be intelligible as a statement, it must be able to serve as and
stand in need of reasons.

2.  You have to be able to tell what somebody has committed themselves
to,

3.  And whether they are entitled to that or not.


# Things we talk about


## Points

Things are at places.  These places are points.  Sensation works by an
entity swivling around to face a point and firing a stream of
particles.

### The origin

As a subject yourself, you are the center of your world.  You are the
center of your universe.  Just like everybody else.

Where you are at is a position.  There are other objects and agents
tho, and they are at other positions.  So positions are something we
are going to have to talk about.

##  Vectors

A vector is the result of a sensation.  Its a straight line starting
at the origin, and ending at another point.

It has a direction--from the origin to the far point.

It has length. The length is related to the time it takes for the sensing
particles to travel from the senser to the sensed and back again.


### Constraints from the intersubjective position on what we have to be able
to do with vectors.

#### Existence of inverse

Subjects can sense each other.  Say the result of A sensing B is the vector
v.  Since A can (by the intersubjective condition) imagine what A would
look like from the viewpoint of B, A needs to be able to calculate
from v what vector B would sense if B sensed A.

We call this vector the inverse of v.


Consider the following scenario, told from the point of view of
Ashley, at Ashley's origin.  Ashley senses Baily, and gets a vector u
as a result.  Ashley then senses another object, and gets a vector v
as a result.  Ashley knows that Baily wants to know where the object
is.

From the intersubjective condition, Ashley can communicate to Baily
what Baily should expect to sense.  Suppose if Baily *were* to sense
the object, Baily would get the vector w as a result.  To Communicate
this, Ashley needs to have some operation available by which Ashley
could compute w from v and u.

Define "vector subtraction" to be this operation.  w = v - u.

From the intersubjective condition, Ashley can communicate to Baily
any possible sensation Baily could have.  So we can say that any
vector can be written as the result of a subtraction of two other
vectors.

We would want this operation to have an inverse operation--lets call
it vector addition.  Suppose Baily tells Ashley that Baily has sensed
vector v3.  Ashley wants to know what the result of sensing the same
object would be.  v1 = v3 + v2.

Put in here considerations of when Ashley is sensing Baily and vice
versa and how their vectors have to be opposites.
