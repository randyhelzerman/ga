Properties and Objects
======================


the incompatible difference between "incompatible" and "different"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some properties are different from each other.   e.g. "red" is different from "cubical"

Some properties are incompatible with each other.  e.g. "red" and "green".

A single object can have two properties which are different from each other.

But a single object can not have two properties which are incompatible with each other.

Objects are coalescing clusters of compatible properties.



Functions
---------

Objects are also functions.  They are already lambda abstracted in all kinds of ways.
The holes are just where you could put another property which isn't incompatible with
the properties which are already there.

The process of aquisition of a property is functional application.l
